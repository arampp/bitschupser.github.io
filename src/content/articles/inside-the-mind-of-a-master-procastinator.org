Yesterday, I watched a very inspiring TED talk.

- Link to TED talk: [[https://youtu.be/arj7oStGLkU][Inside the mind of a master procrastinator | Tim Urban - YouTube]]
- Speaker's blog: [[https://waitbutwhy.com/][Wait But Why]]
- Nice picture: 3 persons in the head
  + The "Rational Decision Maker"
  + The "Instant Gratification Monkey"
  + The "Panic Monster"
- Very entertaining speaker
- Procastination whit things having a deadline: System works because Panic Monster kicks in
- Problem are areas where no deadlines are in (e.g. health, self development, starting a side business, etc.)
- "A life calendar" (1 page, boxes for a 90 year life)
