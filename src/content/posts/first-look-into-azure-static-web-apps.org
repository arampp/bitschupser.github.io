- Transfer an existing GitHub pages app to Azure devops
- Page will be built with hugo

* Initial Situation
  A while ago, I greated a [[https://github.com/BitSchupser/bitschupser.github.io][static GitHub page]] serving a blog using the
  static web page generator [[https://gohugo.io/][HUGO]]. There was a GitHub action that
  triggered new build and deployed the site everytime I pushed to the
  master branch.

  The aim of the task described here is to keep the repository but
  replace build, deployment and hosting by Azure Static Web Apps.

* Preparations
    Before we can start, there need some preparations and cleanup work to be done:
  1. Delete existing GitHub pages build action, environment and the gh-pages branch.
  2. Delete the existing GitHub actions yaml file.
  3. Create a new resource group in Azure portal.

* Creating the Resource

  Creating the resource is straight forward. Choose "New Static Web
  App", give it a name and a region. Under deployment details, we have
  to connect the web app to our GitHub account and add the
  organization, repository and branch the web app should be built
  from.

  Under "Build Details" we can configure how the app gets
  built. Luckily there is already a preset for HUGO, so we can build
  the site out of the box. There are also other build presets for:

  - Frameworks
    - Angular
    - React
    - Svelte
    - Vue.js
    - (client-side) Blazor
  - Static site generators
    - Gatsby
    - Hugo
    - VuePress

For other technologies, we could choose "Custom" and configure the
build as a step in GitHub actions.

* Adding a custom domain

* Adding a change

* Looking under the hood
